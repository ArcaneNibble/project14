# XC9500 series architecture "vital stats"

* 18 macrocells per function block
* Available with 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 16 function blocks
* Up to 192 IO pins
* 90 product terms per function block
    * 5 product terms per macrocell, with product term steering/stealing/allocating
* 36 inputs per function block from the interconnect
* Partial wired-AND interconnect

# Overall .jed file structure

.jed files for XC9500 begin with a set of magic comments:

```
N VERSION P.20131013*
N DEVICE XC9536-5-VQ44*
N PPMAP 7 1*
N PPMAP 18 12*
N PPMAP 19 13*
...
```

The `PPMAP` comments appear to be a mapping between the pins on the chosen
package and pins on a "canonical" package.

The fuse array then begins with a pattern of 9 sets of 8 bits followed by
6 sets of 6 bits like so:

```
L0000000 00000011 00000011 00000011 00000011 00000011*
L0000040 00000011 00000011 00000011 00000011 000000*
L0000078 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000*
```

This pattern repeats 72 times for a total of 216 lines or 7776 bits. For the
purpose of later discussions, this will be called "the first pattern."

After this, the fuse array then has a pattern of 1 set of 8 bits followed by
4 sets of 7 bits like so:

```
L0007776 11111111 1111111 1111111 1111111 1111111*
```

There are a total of (number of macrocells) lines of this pattern for a total
of 1296 bits in the XC9536. For the purpose of later discussions, this will be
called "the second pattern."

The entire fuse array pattern described so far repeats for each function block
(so the XC9536 has two sets for a total of 18144 bits).

# Major blocks of the fuse array

## AND array

The bits for the AND array live in the first pattern. The first 6 bits of the
first 9 sets of 8 bits as well as all the bits of the 6 sets of 6 bits belong
to the AND array. These are the bits that are 0 in the above example.
This gives 15 sets of 6 bits repeated 72 times, or 6480 bits, which is the
expected number of bits in the AND array (90 product terms * 26 inputs * 2 bits
for each of true and complement).

The bits for each product term run "vertically" such that the first product
term is controlled by bits 0, 108, 216, and so on. A 1 bit means that the input
is used. The "complement" input appears "above" the "true" input.

The inputs to the product terms appear to be in order, but the product terms
do not appear to be in order relative to the macrocells. TODO: Finish checking this.

## Interconnect wired-AND section

The bits in the second pattern appear to be entirely for the interconnect
wired-AND section. The bits again appear to run "vertically" such that the
first input is controlled by bits 7776, 7812, 7848, and so on.

Everything here appears to be in the "natural" order. Moving "right" appears
to move to the next input line and moving "down" appears to move to the next
macrocell. TODO: Finish checking this.

## Macrocell bits

The bits for the macrocells live in the first pattern. The macrocell bits are
the bits that do not make up the AND array bits, or the last two bits of the
9 sets of 8 bits. These are the bits that are 1 in the above example. There
are 18 bits each repeat and a total of 72 repeats. These bits are again read
"vertically" so each macrocell has 72 config bits.

The config bits for each macrocell appear to be in order, but the macrocells
are not in order. In the order from lowest to highest fuse bit number, the
macrocells are in the order
0, 9, 1, 10, 2, 11, 3, 12, 4, 13, 5, 14, 6, 15, 7, 16, 8, 17. TODO: Check for non-36

For future discussion, the "top" bit in each macrocell (e.g. bits 6, 7, etc.)
will be called "macrocell bit 0" and the "bottom" bit in each macrocell
(e.g. bits 7674, 7675, etc.) will be called "macrocell bit 71."

    0 = slew is fast
    1 = slew is slow (TODO test this)

# Product term allocator configuration

the pairs of macrocell bits [12, 13], [14, 15], [16, 17], [18, 19], [20, 21]
control the product-term allocator demuxes
    00 = p-term to "special" function
    01 = p-term to this macrocell's OR gate
    10 = p-term to the exporting OR gate
    11 = p-term not used?

the special functions are in order: clock, OE, reset, set, XOR

macrocell bit 22 controls the inversion of the local OR/XOR gate (TODO: Where exactly, does it matter?)
    0 = invert the output
    1 = do not invert

macrocell bit 23 enables importing p-terms from the macrocell "above"
    0 = import
    1 = do not import

macrocell bit 24 enables importing p-terms from the macrocell "below"
    0 = import
    1 = do not import

macrocell bit 25 controls the exported product term direction ???
    0 = export "up"
    1 = export "down"

macrocell bit 26 controls the speed/power of the OR gate
    0 = high power and fast
    1 = low power and slow

macrocell bits [50-54] control the speed/power of the product terms
    0 = high power and fast
    1 = low power and slow

# Signature bits

The signature lives in macrocell bits 6 and 7 of FB0 in all macrocells except 8
and 17. All the bits need to be inverted. The signature is much more readable
in _permuted_ bit order. Using the original .jed macrocell order, reverse every
pair of bits and then invert to yield the signature (skipping the last 2 bits
in each row because they correspond to macrocells 8 and 17).

As an example, suppose we start with:

```
L0000648 00000001 00000000 00000001 00000011 00000001*
L0000688 00000010 00000000 00000000 00000011 000000*
L0000726 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000*
L0000756 00000001 00000000 00000011 00000011 00000011*
L0000796 00000010 00000011 00000011 00000011 000000*
L0000834 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000*
```

First we extract only the macrocell bits and get:

```
01 00 01 11 01
10 00 00 11

01 00 11 11 11
10 11 11 11
```

Discarding macrocells 8 and 17 we get:

```
01 00 01 11 01
10 00 00

01 00 11 11 11
10 11 11
```

Reversing every pair of bits and putting everything onto one line we get:

```
10 00 10 11 10 01 00 00 10 00 11 11 11 01 11 11
```

Inverting we get:

```
01 11 01 00 01 10 11 11 01 11 00 00 00 10 00 00
```

Converting to hex we get:
```
746f7020
```

So the signature is 'top '.

# Global nets

The global net configuration bits live in macrocell bits 0, 3, and 4 of FB0.
